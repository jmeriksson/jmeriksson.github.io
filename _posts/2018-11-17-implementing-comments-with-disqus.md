A downside of using Jekyll when creating a blog, as opposed to using WordPress for example, is that there is no built in commenting system. Disqus offers an easy solution to this problem by letting web designers sign up for a free account and then just put a pre-written code on their web site. I used Disqus to enable comments on my blog posts on this web site and although it was a bit tricky to get everything working the way I wanted it to. I am very happy with the result.
