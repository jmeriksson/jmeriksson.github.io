In this post, I will briefly go over my thouhts on static site generators in general and Jekyll in particular. Building this site is my first experience with a static site generator so I do not have enough experience to give a full-fledged review. Instead you should view this post as a few initial thoughts from someone who have struggled (and perhaps managed) to set up a basic Jekyll site, changed its appearance a bit and started writing some blog posts on it. Okay, here we go!

### Content over design
While I am aware that there are several ways to change the design of a Jekyll site (I simply haven't learnt them yet) I would argue that building a web site using a static site generator is best for those who wants to focus heavily on text content rather than on flashy design. Changing the appearance of a Jekyll site simply isn't as intuitive as it is with, for example, a WordPress site. When building my first WordPress site I simply had to watch a 90 minute YouTube video and after that I was ready to go. In order to learn Jekyll I had to read documentation, google a lot, watch videos and ask in forums. Of course, I had the disadvantage of starting of from a theme (called Minima) which meant that I couldn't follow along in the tutorial on [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). I believe themes are a great way to change the appearance of a Jekyll sites, but from a web developer perspective I would prefer to have started from scratch to learn the basics, and then moved on to using themes later.

## Conclusion
So, if I were to create a beautiful and flashy web site for a customer I would not use a static site generator (at least not given my limited experience with Jekyll), instead I would have used WordPress, Bootstrap or just generated the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files myself so that i would have complete control over the output. But if I would want to create a simple web site where I could post articles or have a blog with a particular niche (for instance, video game reviews or something like that) I believe that Jekyll is a great choice.
