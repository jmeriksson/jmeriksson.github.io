The Open Graph Protocol uses a website meta data, placed within the `<head>` element, to enable easy sharing of a website on social media, such as Facebook. An important aspect of the Open Graph Protocol is to make it simple for developers to implement. By building on existing technologies and using `<meta>` tags, which is already a familiar concept with developers, the learning curve when starting to use Open Graph Protocol is not very steep.

## The metadata
In order to turn web pages into graph objects, developers have to add these four metadata to a page:
 - `og:title`
 - `og:type`
 - `og:image`
 - `og:url`
