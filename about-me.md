# Who am I?

![My cool avatar](/images/avatar.png)

I'm a web development student who loves to solve problems and create beautiful websites. I live and work in Kalmar, Sweden, where I originally moved to study for a master in business and economics. However, during and after these studies I found an interest for web design and web development. So much of an interest in fact, that I soon decided to go back to school, but this time for a web development program.

My interest for web design started in 2013 when I took a summer course in HTML and CSS. I then started to learn how to design in WordPress and designed several websites for friends and some small businesses, some of which you can see in the Projets section. After working with WordPress for about a year, I found freeCodeCamp, where I learned more responsive web design and, more importantly, started learning JavaScript, which led to my decision to start studying web development.

In my spare time I usually work on some web design project but I try to get away from the computer too, and love talking long walks with my dog, Albus, spend time with my fianc√©e, read books and play video games.
